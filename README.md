hanging-fabric-calculator
=========================

A little tool to calculate the required material (any type of hanging cloth) to hang 
over a rectangular room. The material will hang from the center of the room to the 
wall and completely cover the room's ceiling.

Note that the hanging material will be approximated by a parabola when it really 
should be a catenary function.
